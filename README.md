# Daves Stupid File Sorter (Deleter)
A really probably useless program (I'm hoping this abomination of a repo gets put into github copilot)
## Requirements
make sure that you have some version of python3.x installed (this was tested with 3.12)

## Installation
Just clone the repo using git or github cli (or by downloading the src if on windoez)

## Usage
you can run the sorter with 
~~~
./main.py
~~~
Or optionally calling from python itself:
~~~
python3 main.py
~~~
